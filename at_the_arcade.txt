When I go to the zoo with my Best Friends
(plural noun) there are lots of games to play. I spend
lots of time there with my friends. In the game X-Men
you can be different(its not good to be different). The
point of the game is to Kill(verb) every
robot. You also need to save people. Then you can
go to the next level.
 In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker
and you try to destroy every sand people. In
a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat
every computerized vehicle that you are
Fricking against loser.
There are a whole lot of other cool games. When
you play some games you win Shoes (plural
noun) for certain scores. Once you're done you can
cash in your tickets to get a big fish (noun). You
can save your Clowns for
another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't
believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a
lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade! 

WHY CAN'T THIS SHIT WORK OUT!!!
